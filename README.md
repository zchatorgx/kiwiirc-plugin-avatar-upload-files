loadmodule "extjwt";
extjwt {
    method "HS256";
    expire-after 30;
    secret "j1kQiXVUngKUGH3sadsdpkR59wYOqNWB3Egtur8=";
}

KiwiIRC Plugin Configuration
Assuming you already have a plugin list, add the following lines:

Add this line to the plugin list:

json
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
{"name": "avatar-upload", "url": "/static/plugins/plugin-avatar-upload.js"}
Configure the plugin:

json
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
"plugin-avatar-upload" : {
    "api_url": "https://kiwi.zchat.org/avatars/api.php",
    "avatars_url": "https://kiwi.zchat.org/avatars/",
    "preload_avatars": false,
    "set_avatars": true
}
Important part:
The API file should be accessible at:

https://kiwi.zchat.org/avatars/api.php

The avatars directory should be at: https://kiwi.zchat.org/avatars/

API File:
You can download and save the API file from the following link:
ðŸ‘‰ https://paste.nginx.org/8f

Save this as api.php.

For better organization, place it inside:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
/var/www/html/avatars/
Which means it will be accessible at:
https://kiwi.zchat.org/avatars/

Avoid unnecessary directories to keep things simple!

For easier DNS management, consider using a subdomain such as:
chat.zchat.org instead of chat.zchat.org

This will make it easier to configure Nginx settings.

Additional Requirements:
Download and upload the following files to your server:
ðŸ‘‰ https://github.com/ItsOnlyBinary/kiwiirc-plugin-avatar-upload/tree/main/server-php

Inside this folder, ensure you have the vendor directory, as api.php requires it:

php
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
Nginx Configuration for KiwiIRC and Avatars Directory
These settings allow avatar uploads under the subdomain kiwi.zchat.org.

ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have an SSL certificate for kiwi.zchat.org!

After setting everything up, restart the services:

bash
Kopyala
DÃ¼zenle
systemctl restart kiwiirc
systemctl restart nginx
Final Notes:
The service is now live at:
ðŸ‘‰ https://web.zchat.org
